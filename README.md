Dark Moles is a 2D demake of Dark Souls, where you can experience the repeated soul-crushing defeat of Dark Souls, 
but instead of a titanic monster, you're fighting a giant mole (yay!). 

Who doesn't love moles, after all! Well, you might not after being repeatedly smacked around by one. 
All the frustration of Dark Souls plus a healthy helping of moley goodness.

All sprites, sounds and gameplay were created by me, with the exception a few lovely CC0 assets courtesy of Sudocolon (http://opengameart.org/users/sudocolon) and Kenney (http://kenney.nl). (music and fonts respectively) 

While there were parts of the game I was unsatisfied with, I learned a lot from working on this game and impressed myself with how much I finished solo in 48 hours. 
48 hours isn't very much time, and I spent a lot longer than I thought I would creating art assets. 
The game also ended up being a lot more frustrating than I hoped. I didn't have enough time to get people to playtest, 
and I was a biased judge of difficulty since I knew all the mechanics inside and out.
The controls were far too frustrating as well. I had wanted to replicate the weighty controls of Dark Souls games, 
but instead ended up making them merely feel sluggish and unresponsive.
